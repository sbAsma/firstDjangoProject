# firstDjangoProject
Getting started with Django

## Getting started:
1- cd into the folder that contains the Django project (Charef's file).
2- Run the command "pipenv shell" which stands for activating the virtual environment (again, should check if this has to be done each time).
3- In order to exit the virtual environment I have to run "deactivate" and then "exit".
4- Installing Django has to be through pipenv (Should ask Charef why) by running the command "pipenv install django".
5- In order to start a new Django project, I had to type and run "django-admin startproject <Project Name>".

## Starting the Server:
1- cd inside the folder that contains "manage.py" (run dir to make sure I am inside this folder).
2- ctrl + C gets you out of the server.

P.S. Execute the command "pipenv install" to install the virtual environment (I'm not sure if I have to do this each time?)
